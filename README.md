TeamPayrollBoard
================

An Information Radiator for my development team "Team Payroll".  We use Youtrack as a Kanban board and for tracking pieced of work on and off the board which is then in connected to Team City and a private Git server.

While Youtrack is great for getting an overall feel for where we are, I wanted an information radiator (screen) that would tell me a few key pieces of information that were really easy to read:

<ul>
<li>Which patches have made progress recently</li>
<li>How many patches are in each state</li>
<li>How many we have remaining to sign off</li>
<li>How many working days we have left</li>
</ul>
